    <p class="info-line"><span class="journal-name">Abstract:</span>This paper investigates the market dynamics of ETFs tracking U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) from 2018 to 2024, a period marked by significant fluctuations in inflation expectations and realized inflation. The TIPS ETF market has experienced substantial variation in assets under management (AUM), with meaningful differences across individual funds. Our findings suggest that ETF characteristics, such as duration and liquidity, are important drivers of investor behavior. Preferences for medium- and short-duration TIPS ETFs indicate tactical positioning in response to changing inflation expectations. We show that inflows into TIPS ETFs accelerated during periods of elevated inflation and market uncertainty, while subsequent outflows closely tracked Federal Reserve policy actions rather than realized inflation. This analysis sheds light on how macroeconomic conditions, monetary policy, and fund-specific features interact to shape investor behavior in ETFs tracking Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.

    <p class="info-line"><span class="journal-name">Abstract:</span> Homeownership is a central component of household wealth in the United States, with home equity comprising nearly 29% of household wealth in 2021. Mortgage re- financing allows homeowners to modify their mortgage terms, often resulting in lower monthly payments and increased financial flexibility. This thesis investigates how mortgage refinancing affects household consumption between 2000–2005 and 2017– 2022, using Consumer Expenditure Survey microdata and an event study design. I analyze total consumption and disaggregated categories—durable goods, nondurables, and services—comparing refinancing households to those who do not refinance. Results show that refinancing is associated with a 16% increase in consumption, particularly in durable and nondurable goods. However, responses vary by demographic characteristics: households of color, larger families, and college-educated individuals exhibit smaller increases in consumption, while older households show stronger responses. These findings underscore the role of refinancing as a transmission mechanism of monetary policy and highlight the importance of considering demographic differences when evaluating its economic effects.

    <p class="info-line"><span class="journal-name">Abstract:</span> This paper examines major U.S. ETFs as vehicles for young investors seeking to build wealth and save for early retirement. We provide a comparative analysis across funds from 2000 to 2025, focusing on key metrics including price, net asset value (NAV), assets under management (AUM), shares outstanding, total return, and valuation ratios such as P/E and P/B. The article questions how a $10,000 investment in these funds would have performed over the last 25 years. The analysis is organized into three sections: Section 1 conducts a comparison of ETF characteristics and market measures; Section 2 evaluates historical returns over five-, ten-, and 20-year horizons; and Section 3 outlines the metrics, benchmarks, and models used to evaluate the potential of these funds. By documenting historical performance and market dynamics, this study provides insights for young investors on selecting ETFs that balance growth potential, risk, and portfolio impact.
