	<p style="font-size:18px; color: black" >100 Doors Property Management LLC is an early-state real estate management and development venture dedicated to building a balanced portfolio of housing that meets a variety of needs. We aim to build knowledge and expertise in housing markets in and around the south suburbs of Chicago. Our strategic investment decisions are driven by data, market research, and thorough property analysis.
	<p style="font-size:18px; color: black" >We have completed the renovation of two apartment units, transforming them into functional and attractive housing that serves as a cornerstone for future developments. Alongside active property management, we conduct comparative analyses of distressed properties to assess value potential and identify opportunities where strategic renovations can enhance market performance. Our ongoing research includes developing reports on Midwestern housing markets using the FHFA Home Price Index, with focused analyses of home value trends in the south suburbs of Chicago.
