	<p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.6;">I am an aspiring entrepreneur and independent financial researcher.
	<p></p>
	<p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.6;">I am currently focused on building <a href="https://annaisgangolf.github.io/100DoorsLLC/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:500;">100 Doors LLC</span></a>, an early-stage real estate management venture in the South Suburbs of Chicago. In addition to managing properties, I conduct data collection and analysis on local housing markets to understand changes in market conditions and identify potential investment opportunities. I am currently pursuing my broker’s license to deepen my understanding of the industry. 
	<p></p>
	<p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.6;">I believe economic research is a conduit for advantageous investment strategies and the forces that shape markets, consumer welfare, and long-term economic outcomes. My research interests include monetary policy, bond markets, real estate, and flagship ETFs. A subset of my work aims to uplift young investors by investigating how financial tools can build wealth. 
	<p></p>
	<p style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.6;">I graduated with a bachelor’s from <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight:500;">Haverford College</span></a> with a major in Economics and a minor in Mathematics. Outside of academics, I participated in projects dedicated to economic research and impact investing, where I further honed my analytical skills and applied them to real-world problems.
